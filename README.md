# Data-Visualization-Challenge
I approched this challenge by using the templet provided by the profesor.
I received help from Xpert Learning when i had a was not able to figure out how to find the duplicate formula. Xpert Learning gave me an idea on how to use the duplicate function and then i applied it.
I also asked Xpert Leraning for the formula to find SEM. I used the ideas provided to apply it to my scenerio.
In addition, I also asked Xpert Learning how to use the dunction "agg" and i applied the information to my scenerio.
In my bar and pir chart, i was having trouble finding the timepoint counts becuase i had "valuecounts" and Xpert Learning help me understand that i only needed "count".
I worked plotting the bar and pie chart by referincing assignements done in class. 
In the Quartiles and outliers, i received help from th TA because i was getting stuck with the forloop. 
Once i figured that out i was able to fin teh outliers.
The TA also assisted me with creating my box plot.
For the line and scatter plot, i refered back to assignments done in class to guide me on how to create the graphs. 
For the correlation and regression, i refered back to class assignments to complete this section.
